# How to use your server
1. clone / copy the files to your computer or project folder
2. `npm install <port number>` where port number is any number (try 9000 for starters)
3. `echo "node_modules" > .gitignore"
4. `node server.js`
5. open your browser to `localhost:<port number>`
5. When you are ready to turn off the server, hit `CTRL + C`
